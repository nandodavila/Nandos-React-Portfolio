      <h1>About Me </h1>
      <p>
        I have been in construcion industry for the last 9 years. I have done a lot of buildings contributing to the Midtown Atlanta skyline.
        I wanted to start the journey into Web Devolopement because I really enjoy building and creating stuff, however construcion is very hard on ones body.
        The concept behind all things Web Devolopement has always intrigued me, and I'm very excited to get started working in this field
        I believe some of my key skill I've learned in Constuction and mechanical piping will help me in this field. The most important of which will be,
        my creative problem solving skills. Often in constuction you have to be creative and think outside the box to fix some of the problems that come up.
        I feel this will help me with debugging and other things in the future.
        Since I was a foreman for almost 5 years, I feel I have very good management skills. I hope this helps me in the future climb the ranks to potential project management.
